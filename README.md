<h1>Planet of The Republic (POTR) web design</h1>

 ### Project I did to upskill my CSS designs

<h2>Description</h2>
Project I did to upskill css design from basic to more professional and asthetically pleasing CSS design. With help of my friend who came up with the idea of the fictional planet (POTR), I themed the project around his fictional planet. I researched how to improve my CSS designs through youtube tutorials and coded the site. My friend helped with the content that should be displayed on the site and even gave me feedback to improved, change or add details to the design.
